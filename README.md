# Financial Knowledge Graphs

A toolset for extracting financial knowledge from text and building queryable knowledge graphs in Neo4j.

## Overview

Financial Knowledge Graphs leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured financial knowledge from unstructured news articles. The extracted information is stored in a Neo4j graph database, creating a queryable knowledge graph of financial entities and their relationships.

## Features

- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract structured financial information from unstructured text using LLMs
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Store extracted entities and relationships in Neo4j for querying and analysis
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI GPT models and local LLMs (Llama3 8B) via Ollama
- **Advanced Evaluation**: Compare extraction results against high-quality ground truth
- **Batch Processing**: Process large datasets efficiently with OpenAI's Batch API (50% cost savings)
- **Financial Ontology**: Clear schema for financial entities and relationships - see [Ontology Guide](docs/ontology.md)

## Installation

> **Prerequisites**: This project requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. Make sure it's installed before proceeding.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-knowledge-graphs.git
   cd financial-knowledge-graphs
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. Start Neo4j (using Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j
   ```

## Usage

All functionality is accessible through a unified command interface:

```bash
# Extract financial knowledge with LLMs
python -m src.main llm

# Evaluate extraction results
python -m src.main evaluate

# Neo4j database operations
python -m src.main neo4j

# Retrieve batch processing results
python -m src.main batch <batch_id> [options]
```

The application is configured through YAML files in the `configs` directory. For detailed configuration options and advanced usage, refer to the [Execution Configuration Guide](docs/execution_configs.md).

## Key Capabilities

### Knowledge Extraction

The system extracts financial entities and relationships from text:

- Identifies company entities with attributes (name, ticker, industry, country) and extracts key financial relationships (acquisitions, mergers, debt, equity stakes)
- Transforms unstructured text into structured knowledge triplets
- Supports local execution with Llama3 models (see [Ollama Setup Guide](docs/ollama_setup.md))

### Batch Processing

For processing large datasets efficiently. _Only available when using OpenAI as the LLM provider_.

- Processes thousands of articles with 50% cost savings versus standard API calls
- Intelligently splits large datasets into manageable batches, avoiding reprocessing duplicate articles
- Tracks processing status across all batches

### Ground Truth and Evaluation

Evaluation against high-quality ground truth from multiple sources:

- **Synthetic Ground Truth**: Perfectly formatted examples for schema validation
- **Expert LLM Ground Truth**: Generated by advanced LLMs using detailed reasoning

### Knowledge Graph Schema

The project uses a domain-specific financial ontology to structure information in Neo4j. For details on entity types, relationship types, and properties, see the [Ontology Documentation](docs/ontology.md).
